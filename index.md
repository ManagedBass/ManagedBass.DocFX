[![Release](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ManagedBass.PInvoke.svg?style=flat-square)](https://nuget.org/packages/ManagedBass.PInvoke)  
**ManagedBass.PInvoke** is the core library of ManagedBass containing the .Net interop code for un4seen [BASS](http://un4seen.com/bass.html) audio library.

> If you just need the basic functionality of getting BASS API wrapped, always prefer **ManagedBass.PInvoke** because it is much more API stable.

## Why?
The existing BASS.NET wrapper is closed-source and needs to be licensed for commercial use.  
ManagedBass is free and open-souce.  
Also, it tries to make the API friendly to a .NET developer.

Lots of sample repositories are available on the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/ManagedBass) to get you started.
