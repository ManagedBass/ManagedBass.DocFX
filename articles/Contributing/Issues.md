# Filing Issues
When filing issues, the best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.
1. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
2. What are the EXACT steps to reproduce this problem?
3. Did you include details of Platform and any plugins used?

> Use Issues ONLY for Reporting Bugs, for Questions and the like Chat on Gitter.

GitHub supports [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
